# Access2Justice

We are a volunteer team of hackers working with [The Commons Law Center](https://thecommonslawcenter.org) to make a difference in reducing the time and money it costs for people to have legal services.

Here you will find information on the current projects, documentation and network status. If you want to **contribute** checkout our [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeForPortland/access2justicePDX/) and our [contribution guide](https://github.com/CodeForPortland/access2justicePDX/).
