## Git

You should have git installed on your machine. If you don't you might want to pause your reading this guide and familiarize yourself with git here [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and make sure you have it installed on your machine. You should also have a basic understanding of how to clone a repo before continuing. 

## GoLang

You wont need to learn `Go` to do this, but you do need to compile it so that the router will run on your machine.

[Go](https://golang.org) is an open source language developed by Google. It is a lower level language like `C++` but built with the wisdom gained from years of headaches from coding. It's also pretty fast and you can explore more of it with the [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)  
 

### Installing Go 

If you like to manually install, you can find the binaries for your machine's processors [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Some common dependency managers can install Go as well.

#### Homebrew
```bash
$ brew install go
```

#### Chocolatey

```bash
C:\> choco install golang
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
$ apt-get install golang
```

## Check Installation

```bash
 go version
```

it should return something that looks like...

```bash

```
