# The Project

Access to legal services is expensive. Many people end up representing themselves in court. The outcomes are not optimal.

## Scope:

Focus on family court. If successful program will be expanded to other fields.

## Project Mission:

Increase the efficacy of the Common’s Law Center by creating software which increases the productivity of its staff.

## Proposal:

A Web form (initially internal, eventually public) which will securely collect information from applicant. This Form will output to a decision tree interface which will allow a *The Commons Law Center* staff member to help triage issues. Appropriate Court Forms are pre-filled with client information. 

- **Output:** Pre-Filled forms as well as a guide to court. Allowing people to better represent themselves. If Applicant meets requirements for representation grant. Info then can be accessed by *Common’s* lawyers.
