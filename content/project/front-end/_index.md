### Interview Wizard

This is what the user will see when they will enter their information.  This will guide them through entering the necessary information to generate the documents.

### Document Management Module

The document manager is an interface that will allow the user to search and organize the various documents which have been generated, or they can create a new one. 
This can help them fine-tune documentation as needed beyond what the wizard populates to suit the particulars of the case. 

### Profile Management Module

Profiles represent a person involved to some degree with documents being generated. This interface will provide tooling for organizing those relations.

### Account Management Module

This interface will be for account managers, to provide access rules to different users, view histories and for basic administrative tooling.

### Dashboard 

A navigation view and landing page that accepts module registration and allows a user to access the different services.
