<p class="intercom-align-left">We’ve put together a set of universal guidelines that we believe every community can
	benefit from and moderators can adopt. Our goal is to ensure that these set of guidelines are easy to understand.
	It’s not meant to be comprehensive, rather focusing on the most commonly shared principles we believe are critical
	for setting a foundation in a community to enable it to thrive.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These
	discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order
	for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to <b>criticize ideas, not people</b>. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;So,
	remember to avoid:</p>
<ul>
	<li>name-calling</li>
	<li>ad hominem attacks</li>
	<li>Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.</li>
	<li>knee-jerk contradiction</li>
</ul>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you
	don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be
	treated.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Always strive to add value to every interaction and
	discussion you participate in</h4>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Keep it tidy</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Help make moderators’ lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to
	post is in the right place. That means:</p>
<ul>
	<li>don’t post off-topic comments or discussions</li>
	<li>don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times</li>
	<li>review any specific posting guidelines for the community: some communities such as a movies community may have
		specific rules regarding spoilers.
	</li>
	<li>check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">If you see something, say something</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing
	community guidelines and, so are you. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you see an issue, <a href="mailto:iamrexdev@gmail.om"
	                                                                                  rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
	                                                                                  target="_blank">contact Rex</a> if
	possible or flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated the Basic Rules, report it to Disqus
	by <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1518428-how-to-report-abuse"
	      rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flagging the user's profile</a>.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Stay On-topic</b></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Be sure your topic matches the general theme of the channel. For example, all discussions
	on <a href="https://disqus.com/home/channel/talkshop/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Talk
		Shop</a> should pertain to fashion and beauty. Not sure if you’re posting to the right channel? Check the
	channel’s About section, or recently-added discussions to get an idea of what subjects are appropriate.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>No Self-promotion</b></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your
	article on another site will almost always be removed.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely</b></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being
	posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame
	will always be removed.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Don’t Be a Jerk</b></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist,
	homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or
	discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Don’t Copy and Paste</b></p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If you didn’t write it, or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post
	it.</p>
